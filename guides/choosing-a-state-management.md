# Choosing a State Manager

State management in Vue applications can be handled using [**Pinia**](https://pinia.vuejs.org/introduction.html) or [**TanStack Query**](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/vue/overview). Below is a guide on when to use each:

## 🟢 Pinia (Global State Management)

### **Best for:**
- Managing global application state (e.g., user authentication, UI state, settings).
- Sharing state across multiple components without prop drilling.

### **Example Usage:**
```js
import { defineStore } from 'pinia';

export const useUserStore = defineStore('user', {
    state: () => ({
        name: '',
        isAuthenticated: false
    }),
    actions: {
        login(userName) {
            this.name = userName;
            this.isAuthenticated = true;
        }
    }
});
```

### **When to Choose Pinia?**
- ✔ If you need reactive, globally accessible state.
- ✔ If your application needs persistent state across pages.
- ✔ If you want a simple and scalable store structure.

## 🔵 TanStack Query (Server State Management)

### **Best for:**
- Fetching and caching data from APIs.
- Automatic background re-fetching when data becomes stale.
- Avoiding unnecessary API calls with cache invalidation.

### **Example Usage:**
```js
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/vue-query';

const { data, error, isLoading } = useQuery(['user'], fetchUser);
```

### **When to Choose TanStack Query?**
- ✔ If your state is mainly fetched from an API and doesn’t need to be manually managed.
- ✔ If you want automatic cache invalidation and synchronization.
- ✔ If you want an optimized and performant way to handle server state.

## 🤔 Which One Should You Use?

| Feature                  | Pinia ✅ | TanStack Query ✅ |
|--------------------------|----------|-------------------|
| Global State Management  | ✅        | ❌                |
| API Data Caching         | ❌        | ✅                |
| Automatic Updates        | ❌        | ✅                |
| Manual State Mutation    | ✅        | ❌                |

---

### **Final Recommendation:**
- If your state is primarily UI-related or requires manual control, use **Pinia**.
- If your state is fetched from an API and needs caching, use **TanStack Query**.
- In complex apps, you can use both together for optimal performance.
